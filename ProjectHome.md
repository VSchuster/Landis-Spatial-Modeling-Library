The LANDIS Spatial Modeling (LSM) Library originated from the [LANDIS-II project](http://www.landis-ii.org/).  LANDIS-II is a forest landscape simulation model.  The LSM library provides the basic functionality needed by spatial models:

  * efficient data structures for storing information for the individual sites (cells) on a landscape, and

  * a simple API for reading and writing raster data files.
